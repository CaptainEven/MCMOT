# MCMOT
One-shot multi-class multi-object tracking(单阶段实时多类别多目标跟踪)
</br>
This is an extention work of FairMOT, which extends the one-class multi-object tracking to multi-class multi-object tracking
</br>

## Pretained model for C5 detection and tracking
#### HRNet18 with bi-linear upsampling replaced with de-convolution </br>
#### The pre-trained model is for 5 classes(C5) detection & tracking: car, bicycle, person, cyclist, tricycle, which can be used for road traffic video surveillance and analysis. </br>
